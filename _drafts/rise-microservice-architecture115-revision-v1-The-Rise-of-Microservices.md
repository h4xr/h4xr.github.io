Microservices is a new term that has recently sprung to life. The term is used to describe a new architecture in designing and building new software applications as small and independent set of services which can be independently deployed and managed.

In the Microservice architecture(MSA), the size of a service is kept into check. More specifically, a microservice architecture aims at services which are small in size and where the accompanying protocols are lightweight. This allows the developers to build services that are working to achieve a particular set of tasks rather than coupling all the tasks into a single monolithic process.

#### The Advantages of Microservice Architecture

  * The Microservice Architecture helps in increased cohesion between different services and reduced coupling. Together this gives rise to improved maintainability of the application and easy modifications.
  * More focused approach: By using MSA, the teams can focus on building individual services that accomplish a particular set of tasks.
